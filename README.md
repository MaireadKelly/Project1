## Design & Planning:

###User Stories
 -As a user I want to be able to navigate the site easily
 -I want to be able find out when and where it's on
 -I want to be able to sign up for a class

### Wireframes
Attach wireframes in this section

### Typography
I used google font types K2D, Lato and Oswald fonts.  I chose these fontsbecause I find they are easy to read while still being stylish.
I used https://fonts.google.com/ to pick my fonts.

### Colour Scheme
rgb(241, 109 , 147, .7) light pink transparent used for cover text background
#5a738e Dark Blue used for header.
#3a3a3a Very Dark Grey used for Social Network links in footer
#dca5b1 Very Soft Red used as main background color
#ffeb99 Very Light Yellow used for headings text
#d1b1c8 used for "Lets Shoot" button
I chose these colors as they contrast well for ease of reading, as well as being pleaing to the eye. ![colorscheme](assets/images/readmeimages/colorscheme.png)

## Features:
### Navigation
The navigation bar is fixed to the top of the screen and has active links to the gallery and join us form pages.
The Sharp Shooters text, on the left side of the navigation bar, is linked to the home page![Navigation Bar](assets/images/readmeimages/navbar.png)

### Header
The header has a hero image of an archer taking aim with a golden sunset in the background.  It also has the club name and location superimposed on the image.![Header](assets/images/readmeimages/header.png)

### Benefits:
I have included an overall view of the benefits (both physical and mental) of archery.![Benefits](assets/images/readmeimages/benefits.png)

### Meetup Times
Information on times that our varoius level meet each week.![Meetup](assets/images/readmeimages/meetup.png)

### Gallery
In the gallery I wanted to show that archery is a sport that is suitable for people of all ages and abilities.  That it can be enjoyed as a recreational, and social outlet, but also has a competitive aspect for those who prefer more of a challenge, from local and national competitions to Olympic and Paralympic levels.![Gallery](assets/images/readmeimages/gallery.png)

### Footer
The footer has navigetion links to the most popular social media sites, namely
Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and YouTube![Footer](assets/images/readmeimages/footer.png)

## Future features
In the future I would like to add some features to make it possible for people to sign up online, not just request someone to contact them.
I would also like to introduce the ability for beginners to pay for their course online and save the need for them to bring money to their first class.  Another feature would to make it possible for current members to renew their membership online.

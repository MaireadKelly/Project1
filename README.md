Love Archery

[Click Here To Visit Live Site]( https://maireadkelly.github.io/Project1/)

## Design & Planning:

###User Stories
 -As a user I want to be able to navigate the site easily
 -I want to be able find out when and where it's on
 -I want to be able to sign up for a class

### Wireframes
Attach wireframes in this section

### Typography
I used google font types Loto and Oswald fonts.  I got my inspiration for this from the Love Running walkthrough project.  I find they are easy to read while still being stylish.

### Colour Scheme
***rgb(241, 109 , 147, .7);***
#ffffff  , I chose these colors as they contrast well for ease of reading.

## Features:
###Navigation
The navigation bar is fixed to the top of the screen and has active links to the gallery and join us form pages.
**There is also a logo on the left/right side of the navigation bar, which is linked to the home page***
###Header
The header has a her image of an archer taking aim with a golden sunset in the background.  It also has the club name and location superimposed on the image.

###Benefits:
I have included an overall view of the benefits (both physical and mental) of archery.  Some of which may be surprising to many people.

###Gallery
In the gallery I wanted to show how archery is a sport that is suitable for people of all ages and abilities.  That it can be enjoyed as a recreational, and sociable outlet, but also has a competitive aspect for those who prefer more of a challenge, from local and national competitions to Olympic and Paralympic levels.

###Footer
The footer has navigetion links to the most popular social media sites, namely
Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and YouTube

## Future features
In the future I would like to add some features to make it possible for people to sign up online, not just request someone to contact them.
I would also like to introduce the ability to pay for beginners to pay for their course online and save the need for them to bring money to their first class.  Another feature would to make it possible for current members to renew online
